This is just me learning rust. Probly not helpful to anyone, but wanted to record my learning.

I went through every page of [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and wrote any code examples they had, and took notes.

I prefixed them all with letters (`aa`, `ab`, etc) to keep them in order, as you can't start a crate with a digit.

I primarily use js & python, and have recent practical experiencce with java, C++, and a few others, so my notes are sort of from that perspective.
