/*
Ownership
- Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

References
- At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid.

Slices
- [start..end] like [5..10] would be 5-10, exclusive
- Don't have ownership, much like reference/borrowing (&)
- They are references to several bytes in a collection.
- First 0 and last len is optional.
- String Literals Are Slices, so use &str as inputs for fn to work for String and str
